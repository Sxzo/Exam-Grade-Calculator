# [Exam Grade Calculator](https://sxzo.github.io/Exam-Grade-Calculator/)

### Purpose
I noticed that the most commonly used final exam grade calculators have outdated and unresponsive UIs. To modernize the process, I created my own calculator website. Nothing new, nothing complicated; just modern. 

## How it works
This website calculates a minimum exam grade necessary to reach a target grade from a current grade given the exam's weight. This value is computed in the backend by using the equation:

```minimumExamGrade = (targetGrade - (1 - (examWeight / 100)) x currentGrade) / (examWeight / 100)```
